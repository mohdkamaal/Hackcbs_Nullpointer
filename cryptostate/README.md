# What is this all about? 👀
* This is a Blockchain-based project that solves many problems of the current Real state system and makes it more secure and makes buying and selling property easy.It is based on the concept of the Non-Fungible Token Marketplace and treat the property as NFT and Uses ERC721 Token to build its all functionality. 
* This project is under HackCBS 4.0


# What's the issue we are trying to solve? 👈
* nowadays There are a lot of fraud going on in the current real state system such as tempting with the property,selling single property to two or more persons, in India, when we buy or sell the property we use paperwork what if the paper lost, what if someone temper with  that paper what is someone modified that paper, in this condition we don't have any proof that this property belongs to us.


# Local development setup

* install truffle 
* install metamask
* Create a test-net on metamask import first account from the ganache-cli 
* install ganache 
* run ganache-cli 
* run truffle migrate --reset 
* run npm start 
* You are ready to go

# Challenges we faced 😵 and how we tried to tackle them ! 🤓💪
Since all of us are beginners and this being our first hackathon, We faced challenges like:
* Developing the Hack in 36 hours ! - this being the first hackathon we faced challenges in managing the time and implement all the features, but later sacrificing the sleep and working with dedication in teams helped to implement all the features we planned within the time limit.
*  Since we wanted to include useful content, so including well researched content in such shorter span was another bigggest challenge we faced  To tackle this I   divided the work and sacrificed sleep so as to provide well researched content to the users.
*  Since the app was in react and in my team no one knows react accept so i had to handle all things such as front-end & backend both toghther.

# Future Plans of Project Cryptostate 📝
* I will be going to work on it's front-end make it more user friedly.
